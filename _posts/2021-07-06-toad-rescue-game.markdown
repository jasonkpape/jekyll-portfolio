## Project Description
<cite>Toad Rescue</cite> is a top-down game in which the user controls a player character who is attempting to collect the greatest number of toads possible within the time limit. This game served as an exercise in animating spritesheets.

## Customization
Students followed along with the instructor to create the base game and were then were required to make the following modifications:

* Replace the wall images while maintaining the dimensions and tunnel positions
* Change the background for all three scenes, making sure that the main scene's background contrasts with the player character
* Add your name to the splash and credit-roll scenes; customize the "Special Thanks" section.


I made the following additional modifications:

* Modified the animation and fonts used in the splash scene
* Replaced the spritesheet for the player character with a spritesheet of my own creation
  * Art assets created using Adobe <cite>Photoshop</cite> and <cite>Illustrator</cite>
  * Extended the spritesheet to include separate running and standing sprites in four directions
* Replaced all sound effects and music with sounds and music of my own
  * Audio assets created with Reason Studios' <cite>Reason</cite>, SFB Games' <cite><a href="https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone" target="_blank">ChipTone</a></cite>, and Adobe <cite>Audition</cite>
* Cutomized the right-hand sidebar's layout and fonts
  * Added retro border image
* Added code to allow the user to skip the credits by pressing ENTER or the spacebar
* Changed theme from coin collection to toad collection
  * Replaced coin sprite sheet
* Added code to ensure that the player could not collect 'invisible' toads (which one could do in the original code)
  * New toads now quickly fade in instead of instantly appearing
* Replaced game-over graphic and animation
* Modified movement code to allow player to run closer to walls
  * Also fixed flaw in original code that did not allow the player to enter a tunnel if they were already adjacent to it
* Replaced tunnels with glowing panels
* Added animated toads to credit sequence

## Hosting and Usability Testing
 A GitHub account was created and the game was hosted at <a href="https://jasonkpape.github.io/toad-rescue/" target="_blank">https://jasonkpape.github.io/toad-rescue/</a>. Students submitted the basic Tumult Hype file along with a link to the actual game for grading.
