## Project Description
This is an implementation of the classic memory game in which the player choose two cards at a time, trying to match what the symbols on the other side. This involved monitoring game states and implementing array sorting algorithms.

## Customization
Students followed along with the instructor to create the base game and were then given two weeks to make the following modifications:

* Personalize the credits scene
* Replace the card-back image
  * Artwork created with Photoshop
* Replace sound effects
  * New sound effects created with Propellerhead Reason
* Modify background and text colors, font sizes, font families, and other text properties

The following additional modifications were made:

* Created alternative exposed-card images with Adobe Illustrator
  * Imported in vector format
* Created new vector artwork for title page, with new stencil animation effect
* Created new music in Propellerhead Reason
* Modified code to deal the cards onto the table in a random order
* Used Tumult Hype's setElementProperty function to create card-flipping animation in credits sequence

Additional audio processing was done with Adobe Audition.

## Hosting and Usability Testing
 A GitHub account was created and the game was hosted at <a href="https://jasonkpape.github.io/memory/" target="_blank">https://jasonkpape.github.io/memory/</a>. Students were then required to find two volunteers and have each perform a usability test. Students submitted the basic Tumult Hype file and the usability test results, along with a link to the actual game for grading.
