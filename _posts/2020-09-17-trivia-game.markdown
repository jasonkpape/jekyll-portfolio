## Project Description
The first project for DGIM 2530 - Game Design 1 creates a simple Trivia Game using Tumult Hype. The project consists of three scenes and utilizes an external Javascript file, which is used to customize the content displayed. Global variables are used to keep track of the score between scenes and are defined in Tumult Hype using the "Edit Head HTML" option.

## Customization
Students followed along with the instructor to create the base game and were then given two weeks to modify the trivia content (questions, answers, and factoids) as well as the color scheme, layout, typography, and other elements. 

For my customization, I wrote a set of questions and factoids related to computer science. Additional changes include:

* New background artwork created in Adobe Illustrator, imported in vector format
* Animations for the title and summary scenes
* Music and sound effects created in Propellerhead Reason, GarageBand, and Adobe Audition
  * plus one sound effect I borrewed from _Space Quest III: The Pirates of Pestulon_ (pub. Sierra On-Line, 1989)
* Modified code to only allow one answer to be clicked, after which the user is awarded points
  * In the original, the user could choose different answers until the timer ran out
* Added drum effect to timer countdown
* Animated scoring text
* Added a continue button between each round so that players have plenty of time to read the post-question factoids
* Background changes color between questions
* 'Typewriter' effect on summary text

## Hosting and Usability Testing
 GitHub account was created and the game was hosted at <a href="https://jasonkpape.github.io/trivia/" target="_blank">https://jasonkpape.github.io/trivia/</a>. Students were then required to find two volunteers and have each perform a usability test. Students submitted the basic Tumult Hype file and the usability test results, along with a link to the actual game for grading.
