## Game
Click <a href="https://jasonkpape.github.io/slider/" target="_blank">HERE</a> to play.

## Project Description
This was an optional assignment. It is a recreation of a sliding puzzle game. The player chooses one of nine images, the number of rows and columns, and whether or not to display numbers on each tile. The computer randomly shuffles the tiles, then the player attempts to rearrange them. A preview of the finished image is shown next to the puzzle for reference.

## Customization
Students followed along with the instructor to create the base game and were then given the option of making the following modifications:

* Create a new theme for the game
* Replace the background image on the splash, hints, and credits screen
* Replace the puzzle images
* Create smaller preview images for the new puzzle images
  * I created new art using Photoshop
* Come up with a new title based on the new theme
* Replace the background music and victory music
  * I created new music using Propellerhead Reason and Adobe Audition
* Update the credits
* Modify colors, font families, and other such details

I made the following additional modifications:

* Increased usability by ensuring that players cannot click on buttons that are not yet visible
* Modified sound button so that it mutes all music by turning down the volume of audio tags referencing the mp3s.
  * The original behavior stopped the background music, then restarted it.
* Looped the background music so that it repeats instead of only playing once
* Created new shuffle music with Propellerhead Reason and Adobe Audition
* Replaced original button sound effect with sound effect created with <a href="https://sfbgames.com/chiptone/">ChipTone</a>.
* Music now stops when the player clicks the "hint" button
* Implemented more efficient algorithm for finding the blank tile while shuffling

## Hosting and Usability Testing
 A GitHub account was created and the game was hosted at <a href="https://jasonkpape.github.io/slider/" target="_blank">https://jasonkpape.github.io/slider/</a>. Students submitted the basic Tumult Hype file along with a link to the actual game for grading.
