## Project Description
This game is a recreation of the classic Space Invaders arcade game. The player controls a cannon that can move left, move right, and shoot upward. The goal is to shoot all of the invaders before they can descend upon the cannont. There are four barriers in place that the cannon can use to evade fire.

## Customization
Students followed along with the instructor to create the base game and were then given the option of making the following modifications:

* Animate the buttons, title, and score information in the summary scene after the game ends
  * Add an animated credits section in the middle of the scene
* Modify the appearance of the six different invader spritesheets
  * I created new spritesheets using Adobe Photoshop
* Replace two of the sound effects in the base game
* Modify the colors of the cannon, laser bolts, and the mothership that passes by at the top of the screen at regular intervals
  * I created new sprites for the cannon and mothership
  * I changed the color of the cannon bolt
  * The invaders now fire bolts chosen randomly from a set of colors, including a shimmering bolt that rapidly cycles colors
* Modify the colors, sounds, and animations for the game-over sequence
  * Created new "GAME OVER" sprites and new music using Reason Studios' Reason and Adobe Audition
  * A red filter fades in over the playing area upon game over
* Change the fonts, colors, and background images in the display panel at the right of the screen
  * Created new background image for display panel using Photoshop

I made the following additional modifications:

* Attempted to change the overall look and feel of the game to match the theme of the new invader spritesheets
  * I replaced all art assets from the base game with art of my own
* Replaced all sound effects and music and created additional audio assets using Reason, Audition, and <a href="https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone" target="_blank">SFB Games' ChipTone</a>
* Added new code so that the game increases in difficulty with each new wave of invaders
* Used <a href="https://www.piskelapp.com/" target="_blank">Piskel</a> to create an animated background
* Implemented optional touchscreen controls
* Decreased the number of variables in the code by using arrays and loops
* Added an animation of the cannon exploding to display when the cannon is struck by one of the invader's bolts
* Implemented code to allow the cannon's and invaders' bolts to shoot away at the barriers as occurred in the original Space Invaders game
* Added additional text effects to inform the player when they receive an extra play or move on to the next wave
* Upgraded collision detection to detect side impacts with bolts

## Hosting and Usability Testing
 A GitHub account was created and the game was hosted at <a href="https://jasonkpape.github.io/space-invaders/" target="_blank">https://jasonkpape.github.io/space-invaders/</a>. Students submitted the basic Tumult Hype file along with a link to the actual game for grading.
